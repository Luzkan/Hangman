# Hangman
Hangman Game for mobile devices
*by Luzkan*.


## About Game
It's my third small project for Android.
This time it's a simple game featuring a dying person (unless the player have dictionary knowledge).
Player needs to guess a word that was randomly chosen from a list. *He doesn't know the word list of course.*
He can either try to guess whole password at once or just try to guess a letter.
If the word/char isn't in the word which he needs to guess, game will prepare another element of a gibbet and show it on the screen.
If player will continue to ask for wrong letters a man will be hunged.

Sounds scary?

Try to be the brave man in your house and save the day of some people by trying out that simple game.

## Project Featuring
