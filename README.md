# Hangman
Hangman Game for Android made in Kotlin
*by Luzkan*.


## About Game
It's my third small project for Android.
This time it's a simple game featuring a dying person (unless the player have dictionary knowledge - then the plot may change).
Player needs to guess a word that was randomly chosen from a .xml list. *He doesn't know the wordlist of course.*
He can either try to guess whole password at once or just try to guess a single letter, however, if the word/char isn't in the word which he needs to guess, game will prepare one of the elements of a gibbet and show it on the screen.
If player will keep missing with his guesses then a man will be hanged.

Sounds scary? Oh yeah, it is.

Be the brave man in your house and save the day of some people by trying out that simple game.
